#### Psychic Game 

### 1. [Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/qTc45Lox97g).

### 2. You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:

*  Guess what letter I'm thinking of

*  Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

*  Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

*  Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

*  Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

####  When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

####  When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
